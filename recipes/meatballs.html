<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <h4>Meatballs</h4>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>¼ cup bread crumbs</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 large egg whites</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple</li>
    <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste</li>
    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>½ cup cold water</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
    <li>Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and egg whites for meatballs together in a bowl until well combined. Form into 1-ounce balls. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Meanwhile prepare sauce: Combine pineapple, soy sauce, brown sugar, and pepper in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.</li>
    <li>Mix cold water and cornstarch together in a small bowl; add to the sauce. Stir and simmer until desired thickness, 3 to 5 minutes. Add meatballs and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
